## Introduction

1. "The keys to achieving more frequent female orgasms were identified in this
   study as being in the mind and in the relationship. These factors and
   capacities included how important orgasms were considered personally; how
   high was sexual desire; how high was sexual self- esteem; and how open was
   sexual communication with the partner. Sexual self-esteem included how
   sexually skillful and how good in bed women considered themselves. Other
   positive factors of orgasmic capacity were the ability to concentrate on the
   moment; mutual sexual initiations; and a partner's good sexual techniques." from
