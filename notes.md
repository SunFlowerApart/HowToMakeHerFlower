## Introduction

1. "The keys to achieving more frequent female orgasms were identified in this
   study as being in the mind and in the relationship. These factors and
   capacities included how important orgasms were considered personally; how
   high was sexual desire; how high was sexual self- esteem; and how open was
   sexual communication with the partner. Sexual self-esteem included how
   sexually skillful and how good in bed women considered themselves. Other
   positive factors of orgasmic capacity were the ability to concentrate on the
   moment; mutual sexual initiations; and a partner's good sexual techniques."

3. Both men and women fake orgasms, but women are much more likely to do so:
   "Both men (25%) and women (50%) reported pretending orgasm (28% and 67%,
   respectively, for PVI-experienced participants). Most pretended during PVI
   [penile-vaginal intercourse], but some pretended during oral sex, manual
   stimulation, and phone sex. Frequently reported reasons were that orgasm was
   unlikely, they wanted sex to end, and they wanted to avoid negative
   consequences (e.g., hurting their partner’s feelings) and to obtain positive
   consequences (e.g., pleasing their partner). Results suggest a sexual script
   in which women should orgasm before men, and men are responsible for women’s
   orgasms."; "Studies using varied methods have found that between one-half
   and two-thirds of the women studied have pretended orgasm."; "More women
   than men reported difficulty orgasming because their partner was unskilled
   (25% vs. 7%, respectively). For example, one woman wrote, ‘‘He was taking
   too long so I just gave up. Basically, he sucked in bed so it was an easy
   way out. [Could you have had an orgasm?] No, he lacks the skills’’"

## Talk about sex


## Generosity

1. The _she comes, then he comes, then it's over_ script is so ingrained in
   culture that it is one of the often reasons for "faking orgasms.

2. From interviews on _reciprocity in sex_ (M/W indicate whether the interviwee
   is a man or a woman, all heterosexual): "A few participants suggested that
   simultaneous orgasm was the best thing in sex, because 'it’s a mutuality in
   it' (M15)."; " that was the quid pro quo really. Ah meaning I didn’t, I did
   not feel good about the idea of having an orgasm, having um intercourse with
   orgasm, with her, if she hadn’t had some orgasms. [...]  um, cause if that
   wasn’t, if that didn’t happen, then I would be using her. That was then.
   Some sense of I would be um, yeah, using her. (M4)"; "Another woman talked
   about the difference in how she and her partner felt about her not having an
   orgasm: ' and sometimes um I don’t at all. Um that’s fine. It worries him
   but it’s actually quite fine with me (W5).' [...] Her partner’s reported
   worries could both reflect sentiments of concern about not 'giving', and/or
   anxieties about 'male competence' – which M4 also reported in saying that
   her not orgasming would mean he had 'failed'."

## It's not (just) about technique

1. "The position with women on top was reported as the most favorable position
   (42.2%) to achieve orgasm by the participants."
