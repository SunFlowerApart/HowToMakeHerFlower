# Make yourself more attractive

You do not need to spend 6 hours at the gym every day or wear very expensive
suits to make yourself look better. But a small effort can go a long way.

First of all, make sure you are taking care care of your personal hygiene. This
should be more obvious than it sometimes is.

Dressing up does not necessarily mean _dress more formally_ or _wear expensive
suits_.


## Fix tension points in your relationship

Now, it would be simpler if sexual pleasure was more directly linked to the
quality of the relationship. In the real world, though, it is not that simple.
However, saying that things are _not that simple_ does not mean that there is
zero possibility for negative effects from relationship tensions to the sexual
life in the bedroom. This is especially the case in the context of a long-term
relationship (which is different from a short-term fling).

This may mean _going to couple's therapy_. If you've had couple's therapy
before, you may already know that it can be helpful not just when the couple is
on the verge of breaking up. In fact, _couple's therapy_ is a bad name for the
practice, which is often _coaching_ and not _therapy_. Professional athletes
have coaches even when they are the best in the world. So, even if you have the
best relationship in the world, you might benefit from coaching.

## Suggested activities

1. _Personal activity_. Spend some money on a make over: Get a real haircut,
   get new clothes (whatever fits your style; it does not have to be a new
   tailored suitâ€”although this may be a good idea too), get new shoes.
