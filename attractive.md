# Make yourself more attractive

You do not need to spend 6 hours at the gym every day or wear very expensive
suits to make yourself look better. But a small effort can go a long way.

First of all, make sure you are taking care care of your personal hygiene. This
should be more obvious than it sometimes is.

Dressing up does not necessarily mean _dress more formally_ or _wear expensive
suits_.


## Fix tension points in your relationship

Now, it would be simpler if sexual pleasure was more directly linked to the
quality of the relationship. In the real world, though, it is not that simple.
However, saying that things are _not that simple_ does not mean that there is
zero possibility for negative effects from relationship tensions to the sexual
life in the bedroom. This is especially the case in the context of a long-term
relationship (which is different from a short-term fling).
