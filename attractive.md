# Make yourself more attractive

Take care of your personal hygiene and dress up. Dressing up does not
necessarily mean _dress more formally_. 

Take time for sex. 

## Fix tension points in your relationship

Now, it would be simpler if sexual pleasure was more directly linked to the
quality of the relationship. In the real world, though, it is not that simple.
However, saying that things are _not that simple_ does not mean that there is
zero possibility for negative effects from relationship tensions to the sexual
life in the bedroom. This is especially the case in the context of a long-term
relationship (which is different from a short-term fling).
