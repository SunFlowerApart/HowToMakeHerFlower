### Not all fantasies are desires

Fantasising about something is not the same thing as desiring it. If you desire
something, you will often fantasize about it. However, the converse is not
true: we often fantasize about things that we do not actually desire in
real-life.

Let me make this point with an extreme example: many women get aroused by rape
fantasies. This is not really up for debate, and several studies have
demonstrated it. Every once in a while, this leads some awful person
(typically, a male activist of some sort) to conclude that, therefore, rape
cannot be so bad. This is completely and utterly wrong. Remember at the start
of the book, we said that _women enjoy sex at that seeminlgy paradoxical
intersection of feeling comfortable and excited_. Well, a rape fantasy can (for
some, but not all, women) fulfill exactly this criteria: it can trigger
feelings of danger and excitement, while being completely safe as it is just a
fantasy.

This is an extreme example and we only bring it up as some people are too
clever and think it proves something, but the general point is that _not all
fantasies reveal a desire_.
