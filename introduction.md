# Introduction

This book should have been called _How to make sex a safe space for her to feel
both at ease and excited so that she naturally has orgasms (most of the time,
and often multiple times, but maybe not always)_. That is a very long
title and it would likely not sell many books, but it is the actual description
of what this book is about. If you want advice on which body parts to tickle
and which to squeeze, there are plenty of online sources out there and I assume
you can use Google. Most of them offer pretty decent technical advice, but most
of them are besides the point.

This books assumes that you are having sex with a woman that is your regular
partner. Maybe she's your wife, or your long-term girlfriend, maybe just a
particularly good friend, but you are developing a relationship with her over a
period of multiple weeks to decades. One-night stands are overrated in terms of
the quality of the sex, anyway. We are also going to assume you are a man.
Maybe this book could also be useful for other couples, but, out of ignorance,
we will refrain from commenting on them. So, here we are: the book, you and
your partner.

## The orgasm gap

The _orgasm gap_ refers to the fact that fewer women have regular orgasms than
men. The numbers vary by study and by country, but almost all men have regular
orgasms during sex, while for women, it's not so clear. Depending on exactly
where and how the question is asked, a third to over half of women report that
they never (or only rarely) orgasm during sex.

Note all women have had sex during which they did not come and that is
perfectly fine. What is not fine is when this becomes the norm in their sexual
lives. If anything, as women are more likely to be capable of multiple orgasms,
they should be coming more. The purpose of this book is to close and reverse
the orgasm gap.

## Notes on stories

All the stories in the book are fictional. Like all literature, they are
composites of real people and experiences, people we've read or heard about,
and people we made up out of whole cloth. Like all literature, we hope they are
illustrative of some form of emotional truth, but they are not literally true.

## Notes on notes

There is a lot of academic research on sexuality. For readability, we are not
mentioning it in the body of the book as we did not want to end up with an
academic book where every sentence contains multiple references. However, at
the end of the book, you will find a chapter with notes and pointers to
scientific literature substantiating all the points that we make in the
chapters.
