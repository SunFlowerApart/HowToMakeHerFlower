This book should have been called _How to make sex a safe space for her to feel
both at ease and excited so that she naturally has orgasms (most of the time,
and often multiple times, but maybe not always)_. That is a very long
title and it would likely not sell many books, but it is the actual description
of what this book is about. If you want advice on which body parts to tickle
and which to squeeze, there are plenty of online sources out there and I assume
you can use Google. Most of them offer pretty decent technical advice, but most
of them are besides the point.

This books assumes that you are having sex with a woman that is your regular
partner. Maybe she's your wife, or your long-term girlfriend, maybe just a
particularly good friend, but you are developing a relationship with her over a
period of multiple weeks to decades. One-night stands are overrated in terms of
the quality of the sex, anyway. We are also going to assume you are a man.
Maybe this book could also be useful for other couples, but, out of ignorance,
we will refrain from commenting on them. So, here we are, the book, you and
your partner.
