# A sexual interests checklist!

This was originally posted at

## Preamble

This checklist was written by [imgomez](https://imgomez.livejournal.com/) and
[scien](https://scien.livejournal.com/), who thought the world could do with a
sexual interests checklist that was not focused on BDSM. Please feel free to
make copies, make your own additions etc, but we ask that you link back here.
We'd also love to know of any changes you thought necessary.

This checklist is intended to give some help to couples just starting out
talking about sex, whether they're already sexually active or not. We've taken
our cues from the issues and questions that often come up in this community,
and hope you'll find it a useful tool.

For those of you not familiar with checklists, it works like this - you each
fill them in, then compare and discuss your answers.

Answer each question with:

- Dislike - won't do
- Not a turn on, but might do it for my partner
- Neutral - don't mind, or not sure
- Quite like
- Really like/love!

This checklist is not intended as a list of The Answers so much as a starting
point for discussion and experimentation. Feel free to add your own extra notes
and comments, for example if you like the idea of something but don't feel
ready for it yet. And remember that your answers are not set in stone - in
fact, expect them to change over time. This is not a binding contract!

Occasionally questions are gender-specific, or can be filled in twice (how do
you feel about doing X and how do you feel about your partner doing X). Skip
questions or answer them twice as you feel is appropriate.

Incidentally - we're sure you lovely people would never neglect to discuss
contraception and STIs before you become sexually active. Health is not really
the subject of this checklist, but in the interests of completeness and safety,
we've included some questions about it at the end, along with links to further
resources.

### The health stuff - contraception

Are you currently on any form of birth control?
Which methods have you used in the past?
Which methods do you prefer?
Are there any medical situations (latex allergy, sensitivity to spermicide, etc) that need to be taken into account?
Do you have EC on hand in case of a contraceptive failure?
What would you do in case of a pregnancy?

Since this is not the place for a full discussion of birth control, we point
you to the following sites for more info: Teenwire, The BBC on contraception,
Consumerreports.org comparative table of contraceptive methods, Emergency
Contraception. birthcontrol is a good place to go if you have any further
questions.


### The health stuff - STIs

- Have you been tested for STIs? when?
- Have you had any sexual partners since?

Anyone who is sexually active (including oral and anal sex) is at risk for
STIs, and many people who have an STI are completely unaware of it. We
recommend you look through the following sites for more info on STIs, testing,
and protection: Planned Parenthood, Teenwire, The ASHA.



### The health stuff - physical and mental health

- Do you have any health issues that your partner should be aware of?
- Are you on any long term medication that might affect your sex life?
- Can you think of any emotional hot spots? things you would absolutely not be okay with, or things that might need extra care?
