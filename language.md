# Talk about sex

## Find your language to talk about sex

If you are having sex with someone, you need to talk to them about it. This
sounds obvious, but too many couples never talk about sex beyond _do you want
to do it?_ and _not now_.

This is not enough. You need to be able to talk about the details of sexual
acts in a descriptive, unambiguous manner. Do you want her to squeeze your
penis while performing a blowjob or do you want to ask her if she would like a
finger up her anus? Different couples find different languages. Some bristle at
the medical _penis_ and _vagina_ and prefer the terms _cock_ and _pussy_;
others feel just the opposite; yet a third category dislikes all of these and
ends up inventing their endearing names for body parts. _None of this matters,
what matters is that you find a set of terms and expressions that you are both
comfortable with and use it_.

It may take a while for you to find the right set of terms. Depending on both
your personalities, this may be best achieved by addressing it head-on (_do you
prefer if I call it "pussy" or "vagina"?_), but it is often done by some
exploration over time about which terms work best for both of you. This is
another reason why one-night-stand sex tends to be disappointing.

## Talking about kinks

_Do not kink-shame, do not vallina-shame_. For some of us, anything beyond
missionary position is kinky, while others will consider anything not involving
multiple people, whips, chains, cameras, and 3 hours of preparatory discussion
to be _basically vanilla_.

It is not even a straight spectrum. Some people have kinks in one area of their
sexuality and are relatively conventional in another (e.g., someone may enjoy
being tied up and whipped, but not be open to the idea of exposing herself to
strangers; while others will be exactly the other way around): kinks are not
interchangeable.

Wherever you are on this spectrum, try to listen to her desires (and possible
kinks) with no judgement.

## Negotiating boundaries

Okay, assume you've gotten this far. You have developed a common language, you
have gotten to the point where you are confortable asking for what you want and
listening to her ask what she wants. Great, you're almost there.

Now, she tells you something that she wants to do to you. There are several
possible reactions:

- _This is something that you really enjoy (or always wanted to do)_. Get a
  room and do it!

- _This is something that does not really appeal to you, but you have no strong
  aversion to it._ For example, she wants you to be wearing a 3-piece suit
  during sex. In general, you should try to be up for it. Watch your language
  (no vanilla shaming, by saying _Oh, that's it? Pfft... One girl once had me
  wearing a bra..._; no kink shaming, by saying _sure, you weirdo_).

- _This is something that you are uncomfortable doing and cannot imagine why
  one would want to do it_. Say **no**. You don't need to justify, no means no.

- _This is something that you are uncomfortable doing, but kind of see the
  appeal_. This can be the toughest situation. This is where clarity helps. You
  need to explain how far you want to go. What is your boundary?

### Can boundaries be re-negotiated during sex?

Yes, absolutely, but **only in one direction**:  the person who has set up
a boundary is allowed to take it down. For example, you can take down
boundaries: imagine that she wants to peg you (use a dildo to fuck you in the
ass), while you have, so far, said no to this idea and to any ass-play at all
(you set up a boundary). If during sex, you suddenly feel an urge to have a
finger inserted in your anus, you can take down that boundary and ask her for
it. In this direction, it is fine and everyone gains from having previously
established desires and boundaries. On the other hand, if she keeps pushing you
into something you do not want or, even worse, acts upon her desires without
asking you, then she has broken a boundary.

You are also, obviously (and this should really go without saying), allowed to
set up new boundaries. This can be either temporary (_not today, put the
strap-on away_) or permanent (_actually, this makes me feel too uncomfortable,
I don't want you to do that anymore_).
